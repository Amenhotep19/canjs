CanJS’s mission is to minimize the cost of building and maintaining JavaScript applications by balancing innovation and stability, helping developers transcend a changing technology landscape.

You shouldn’t have to rewrite your application to keep pace with technology. We constantly integrate new ideas and evolving best practices into CanJS libraries, but in a responsible way that makes it possible to upgrade gracefully. We aim to provide a stable and innovative platform, so you can block out noise and stay focused your app, not the tools.
