CanJS is an evolving and improving set of client side
JavaScript architectural libraries that balances
innovation and stability.  

CanJS targets experienced developers building complex applications
with long futures ahead of them.

If this is you, checkout the quick start guide
where you build TodoMVC in about an hour.

If you're not sure if this is you, the importance of
CanJS's goals, or how CanJS accomplishes these goals, please read on.


## CanJS's Goals

The goal of CanJS can be summarized as follows:

> You shouldn't have to rewrite your application to
> keep pace with technology.

Technology changes quickly.  The popular frameworks and tools
used today will likely not be the same as those used two
years from now.  Even those that might still be around will
probably not be easy to upgrade to.

But developers need stable platforms to develop from.

CanJS attempts to strike a balance between these two
conflicting problems by:

- Providing high quality individually useful and stand-alone libraries.
- Adopting to new ideas/technology and then integrating as new libraries
  or features of existing ones.

The experience of using CanJS should be relatively easy at the start,
but extremely rewarding one over time.  

Bug fixes should be resolved quickly.

New features and libraries should be added that keeps pace with
innovation.

Breaking changes should be simple to migrate.
