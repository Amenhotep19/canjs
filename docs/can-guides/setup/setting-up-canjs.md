## Explanation of different builds

CanJS has a variety of packages, modules, and files ready to meet the needs of
any development environment. This section gives technical details on these items.

- __The individual packages.__

  CanJS is composed from over 80 individual packages.  For example [can-component Component]
  is actually the [can-component](https://www.npmjs.com/package/can-component) package, housed
  in its own [github repository](https://github.com/canjs/can-component). The modules within
  these packages are written in ES5 JavaScript and CommonJS, so they can be imported by Webpack, Browserify,
  StealJS, and a do not require transpiling.

  Apps that need long-term flexibility should installing these packages directly. Direct installation
  means you can upgrade a small part of CanJS when needed.

- __The `can` package__

  CanJS publishes to [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) a
  [can package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/can). It contains:

  - `./can.js` - The main export, imports every CanJS sub project and exports it as
    a ES named export. For example, `can.js` looks like this:

    ```js
    export { default as Component } from "can-component";
    export { default as restModel } from "can-rest-model";
    ...
    ```

    Most module loaders with tree-shaking (ex: Webpack and StealJS) setups
    use this module. Import
    named exports from the `can` package like this:

    ```js
    import {Component, restModel} from "can";
    ```

  - `./dist/can.core.mjs` - An ESM module with named exports of each [core] package bundled
    together. This is useful for examples and prototyping in modern browsers that
    support ES modules and for real-world apps that use just what's in core CanJS.
    It's hosted statically on `unpkg` and can be
    downloaded here.

    You can import directly from the file as follows:

    ```js
    <script type="module">
	import { Component } from "//unpkg.com/can/dist/can.core.mjs";

    	Component.extend({
    		tag: "my-app",
    		view: `Hello {{name}}!`,
    		ViewModel: {
    			name: { default: "world" }
    		}
    	});

    </script>
    ```

  - `./dist/can.ecosystem.min.mjs` - A minified version of `./dist/can.ecosystem.mjs`.

  - `./dist/global/can.js` - A JavaScript file that exports a `can` object with
    core named exports on it. Use this if you want to create a demo or example that will
    work in browsers that do not support ESM.

  - `./dist/can.ecosystem.mjs` - An ESM module with named exports of every* package bundled
    together. This is useful for examples and prototyping in modern browsers that
    support ES modules. It's hosted statically on `unpkg` and can be
    downloaded here.

    You can import directly from the file as follows:

    ```js
    <script type="module">
	import { Component } from "//unpkg.com/can/dist/can.ecosystem.mjs";

    	Component.extend({
    		tag: "my-app",
    		view: `Hello {{name}}!`,
    		ViewModel: {
    			name: { default: "world" }
    		}
    	});

    </script>
    ```

    This file is huge as it includes nearly every extension to
    CanJS. So use of this module in production, without tree-shaking, is
    not advised!

  - `./dist/can.ecosystem.min.mjs` - A minified version of `./dist/can.ecosystem.mjs`.

  - `./dist/global/can.ecosystem.js` - A JavaScript file that exports a `can` object with
    every* named export. Use this if you want to create a demo or example that will
    work in browsers that do not support ESM.

## Hosted setup options (no download needed)

The following shows shows setting up CanJS with scripts hosted online. These are
the easiest ways of setting up CanJS for experimentation.  


### Importing the core ES module bundle with module scripts

The easiest way to get started with CanJS is to [import](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import)
the pre-built ES module from [UNPKG](https://unpkg.com/#/). This is perfect for
demos, examples, or even small apps!

The following `HTML` page imports CanJS and uses it to define a custom element:

```html
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>CanJS + Modules</title>
</head>
<body>
    <my-app></my-app>

    <script type="module">
    import { Component } from "//unpkg.com/can@5/dist/can.core.mjs";

    Component.extend({
    	tag: "my-app",
    	view: `CanJS {{feels}} modules`,
    	ViewModel: {
    		feels: { default: "üòç" }
    	}
    });
    </script>
</body>
</html>
```

The previous example works in all modern browsers, even Edge! If you want to support
older browsers, use the [traditional JavaScript bundle](#IncludingthecoreJavaScriptbundlewithtraditional_script_tags) or one of the module loader setups (Webpack, StealJS).

This build only includes CanJS's [core] and [infrastructure] modules. All modules are exported as named exports. For example, if you want the [can-ajax] infrastructure module, import it like:

```js
import { Component, ajax } from "//unpkg.com/can@5/dist/can.core.mjs";

Component.extend({
	tag: "my-app",
	view: `
        CanJS {{feels}} modules.
        The server says: {{messagePromise.value}}
    `,
	ViewModel: {
		feels: { default: "üòç" },
        messagePromise: {
            default: () => ajax({url: "/message"})
        }
	}
});
```
@highlight 1

If you want an [can-ecosystem] module like [can-stache-converters], you can use
the [ecosystem ES module bundle], but this bundle should not be used in production as it
loads every ecosystem module in CanJS.

__Minified core bundle__

If you eventually do use this built module in production, make sure to switch to
its minified version (`//unpkg.com/can@5/dist/can.min.mjs`) like this:

```js
import { Component, ajax } from "//unpkg.com/can@5/dist/can.core.min.mjs";

Component.extend({
	tag: "my-app",
	view: `
        CanJS {{feels}} modules.
        The server says: {{messagePromise.value}}
    `,
	ViewModel: {
		feels: { default: "üòç" },
        messagePromise: {
            default: () => ajax({url: "/message"})
        }
	}
});
```

> NOTE: Every use of
the unminified url (`//unpkg.com/can@5/dist/can.core.mjs`) must be updated to
the minified version (`//unpkg.com/can@5/dist/can.min.mjs`).

__Importing multiple modules__

You can import multiple modules too. The following shows putting components into their
own modules:

- __index.html__
  ```html
  <!doctype html>
  <html lang="en">
  <head>
      <meta charset="utf-8">
      <title>CanJS + Modules</title>
  </head>
  <body>
      <my-app></my-app>

      <script type="module" src="./app.mjs"></script>
  </body>
  </html>
  ```
- __app.mjs__
  ```js
  import { Component } from "//unpkg.com/can@5/dist/can.core.mjs";
  import "./my-greeting.mjs";
  import "./my-counter.mjs";

  Component.extend({
      tag: "my-app",
      view: `CanJS {{feels}} modules`,
      ViewModel: {
          feels: { default: "üòç" }
      }
  });
  ```

- __my-greeting.mjs__
  ```js
  import { Component } from "//unpkg.com/can@5/dist/can.core.mjs";

  Component.extend({
      tag: "my-greeting",
      view: `<h1>CanJS {{feels}} modules</h1>`,
      ViewModel: {
          feels: { default: "üòç" }
      }
  });
  ```
- __my-counter.mjs__
  ```js
  Component.extend({
      tag: "my-counter",
      view: `
          Count: <span>{{count}}</span>
          <button on:click='increment()'>+1</button>
      `,
      ViewModel: {
          count: {default: 0},
          increment() {
              this.count++;
          }
      }
  });
  ```






### Importing the ecosystem ES module bundle with module scripts

The [core ES module bundle](#ImportingthecoreESmodulebundlewithmodulescripts) only includes CanJS's
[can-core] modules.  This doesn't include ecosystem modules like [can-stache-converters].  The
ecosystem bundle hosted at `https://unpkg.com/can@5/dist/can.core.mjs` includes _nearly_ every CanJS module.

```html
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>CanJS + Modules</title>
</head>
<body>
    <my-app></my-app>

    <script type="module">
    import { Component, stache, stacheConverters } from "//unpkg.com/can@5/dist/can.ecosystem.mjs";

    stache.addConverter(stacheConverters);

    Component.extend({
        tag: "my-app",
        view: `
            <p>Enter a value: <input on:input:value:to="string-to-any(enteredValue)"/></p>
            <p>You've typed a(n) {{enteredType}}</p>
        `,
        ViewModel: {
            enteredValue: "any",
            get enteredType(){
                return typeof this.enteredValue;
            }
        }
    });
    </script>
</body>
</html>
```

The ecosystem bundle does not include:

- [can-zone]
- [react-view-model]

### Including the core JavaScript bundle with traditional `<script>` tags

If you want your demo, example, or small app to work in browsers that do not support ES modules,
then you can use the CDN hosted JavaScript bundle on [UNPKG](https://unpkg.com/#/).  

The following `HTML` page includes CanJS and uses it to define a custom element:

```html
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>CanJS + Modules</title>
</head>
<body>
    <my-app></my-app>

    <script src="//unpkg.com/can@5/dist/global/can.core.js"></script>
    <script>
    can.Component.extend({
    	tag: "my-app",
    	view: `CanJS {{feels}} modules`,
    	ViewModel: {
    		feels: { default: "üòç" }
    	}
    });
    </script>
</body>
</html>
```

This build only includes CanJS's [core] and [infrastructure] modules and all of CanJS's named exports are available on the
`can` object. For example, if you want the [can-ajax] infrastructure module, use it like `can.ajax`:

```js
can.Component.extend({
	tag: "my-app",
	view: `
        CanJS {{feels}} modules.
        The server says: {{messagePromise.value}}
    `,
	ViewModel: {
		feels: { default: "üòç" },
        messagePromise: {
            default: () => can.ajax({url: "/message"})
        }
	}
});
```
@highlight 10

If you want an [ecosystem] module like [can-stache-converters], you can use
the [ecosystem JavaScript bundle], but this bundle should not be used in production as it
loads every ecosystem module in CanJS.

### Including the ecosystem JavaScript bundle with traditional `<script>` tags

The [core JavaScript bundle](#IncludingthecoreJavaScriptbundlewithtraditional_script_tags) only includes CanJS's
[can-core] modules.  This doesn't include ecosystem modules like [can-stache-converters].  The
ecosystem bundle hosted at `https://unpkg.com/can@5/dist/can.core.mjs` includes _nearly_ every CanJS module.

```html
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>CanJS + Modules</title>
</head>
<body>
    <my-app></my-app>

    <script type="module">
    import { Component, stache, stacheConverters } from "//unpkg.com/can@5/dist/can.ecosystem.mjs";

    stache.addConverter(stacheConverters);

    Component.extend({
        tag: "my-app",
        view: `
            <p>Enter a value: <input on:input:value:to="string-to-any(enteredValue)"/></p>
            <p>You've typed a(n) {{enteredType}}</p>
        `,
        ViewModel: {
            enteredValue: "any",
            get enteredType(){
                return typeof this.enteredValue;
            }
        }
    });
    </script>
</body>
</html>
```

The ecosystem bundle does not include:

- [can-zone]
- [react-view-model]

### JS Bin

> > (todo)

Use this JS Bin to play around with CanJS:

<a class="jsbin-embed" href="https://jsbin.com/safigic/28/embed?html,js,output">
  Starter CanJS app on jsbin.com
</a>
<script src="https://static.jsbin.com/js/embed.min.js?4.1.4"></script>

It uses `can.ecosystem.js` so you have the [can-core core], [can-ecosystem ecosystem], and [can-infrastructure infrastructure] modules available to you.


## Prerequisite: Node.js and npm setup

Many of the following sections rely on Node.js and npm installed. Please follow these steps to
get Node.js, npm, and a local file server installed.

First, [go through npm‚Äôs guide to installing Node.js and npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node).
If you‚Äôre new to development, that page has [additional resources](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node#learn-more)
for learning about Node.js, npm, using a command-line terminal, and more.

Next, create a new directory on your computer and navigate to that directory in
your terminal.

In your terminal, [create a new package.json](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/init):

```
npm init -y
```

Next, install [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server)
(so you can load the files we create):

```
npm install http-server --save-dev
```

Next, add a [start script](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/start) to run the
HTTP server. Add the following line to your `package.json`:

```
{
  "name": "my-canjs-app",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "http-server -c-1",
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "keywords": [],
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC",
  "devDependencies": {
    "http-server": "^0.11.0"
  }
}
```
@highlight 7,only

Last, start the HTTP server from your terminal:

```
npm start
```

When the server starts, it‚Äôll tell you the addresses you can open in your
browser to see your project. They will be similar to [http://localhost:8080/].

Next, you can choose to use [StealJS](#StealJS), [webpack](#webpack), or
[Browserify](#Browserify) to load your project.


## StealJS

> > (TODO: git-example)

> You can skip these instructions by
> [cloning this example repo on GitHub](https://github.com/canjs/stealjs-example).

[After setting up Node.js and npm](#Prerequisite_Node_jsandnpmsetup), install `can`, [StealJS](https://stealjs.com) and the [steal-stache] plugin from npm:

```
npm install can@5 steal@2 steal-stache --save
```

Next, add the following [steal configuration](https://stealjs.com/docs/StealJS.configuration.html)
to your `package.json`:

```
{
  "name": "my-canjs-app",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "http-server -c-1",
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "steal": {
    "plugins": ["steal-stache"]
  },
  "keywords": [],
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC",
  "dependencies": {
    "can": "^5.0.0",
    "steal": "^2.0.0",
    "steal-stache": "^4.1.0"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "http-server": "^0.11.0"
  }
}
```
@highlight 10-12,only

Next, create an `app.stache` template for your app:

```html
{{! app.stache }}
<h1>{{message}}</h1>
```

Next, create an `index.js` module for your application. Import [can-component Component] and
your template to say ‚ÄúHello World‚Äù:

```js
// index.js
import {Component} from "can";
import view from "./app.stache";

Component.extend({
  tag: "my-app",
  view,
  ViewModel: {
    message: {
      default: "Hello World"
    }
  }
});
```

Finally, create an `index.html` page that loads `steal.js` and includes your
`<my-app>` component:

```html
<!doctype html>
<title>CanJS and StealJS</title>
<script src="./node_modules/steal/steal.js" main></script>
<my-app></my-app>
```
@highlight 3-4

Now you can load that page in your browser at one of the addresses the HTTP
server showed you earlier (something like [http://localhost:8080/]). You should
see ‚ÄúHello World‚Äù on the page‚Äîif you don‚Äôt, join our
[Gitter chat](https://gitter.im/canjs/canjs) and we can help you figure out what
went wrong.

[guides/recipes]!


## Webpack

> > TODO: git repo, do we need the config?

> You can skip these instructions by
> [cloning this example repo on GitHub](https://github.com/canjs/webpack-example).

[After setting up Node.js and npm](#Prerequisite_Node_jsandnpmsetup), install `can`, [webpack](https://webpack.js.org)
(with [raw-loader](https://www.npmjs.com/package/raw-loader)) from npm:

```
npm install can@5 --save
```

```
npm install webpack webpack-cli raw-loader --save-dev
```

Next, create an `app.stache` template for your app:

```html
{{! app.stache }}
<h1>{{message}}</h1>
```

Next, create an `index.js` module for your application. Import [can-component Component]
and your template to say ‚ÄúHello World‚Äù:

```js
// index.js
import {Component} from "can";
import view from "raw-loader!./app.stache";

Component.extend({
  tag: "my-app",
  view,
  ViewModel: {
    message: {
      default: "Hello World"
    }
  }
});
```

Next, create a webpack config?

```js
const path = require('path');

module.exports = {
  entry: './index.js',
  mode: 'production',
  output: {
    filename: 'bundle.js',
    path: path.resolve(__dirname)
  }
};
```

Next, run webpack from your terminal:

```
./node_modules/webpack/bin/webpack.js -d index.js -o dist/bundle.js
```

Finally, create an `index.html` page that loads `dist/bundle.js` and includes
your `<my-app>` component:

```html
<!doctype html>
<title>CanJS and webpack</title>
<script src="./dist/bundle.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
<my-app></my-app>
```
@highlight 3-4

Now you can load that page in your browser at one of the addresses the HTTP
server showed you earlier (something like [http://localhost:8080/]). You should
see ‚ÄúHello World‚Äù on the page‚Äîif you don‚Äôt, join our
[Gitter chat](https://gitter.im/canjs/canjs) and we can help you figure out what
went wrong.

### Browserify

> You can skip these instructions by
> [cloning this example repo on GitHub](https://github.com/canjs/browserify-example).

CanJS works with [Browserify](http://browserify.org). [After setting up Node.js and npm](#Prerequisite_Node_jsandnpmsetup), install [can-component]
and Browserify (with various plugins) from npm:

```
npm install can-component browserify stringify babelify babel-core babel-preset-env --save-dev
```

By default, Browserify works with CommonJS modules (with `require()` statements).
To use it with ES6 modules (with `import` statements), configure the
[babelify](https://www.npmjs.com/package/babelify) plugin in your `package.json`.
We‚Äôll also include the [stringify](https://www.npmjs.com/package/stringify)
configuration for loading [can-stache] templates:

```
{
  "name": "my-canjs-app",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "http-server -c-1",
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "browserify": {
    "transform": [ [ "babelify", { "presets": ["env"] } ] ]
  },
  "stringify": {
    "appliesTo": { "includeExtensions": [".stache"] }
  },
  "keywords": [],
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC",
  "dependencies": {
    "can-component": "^4.0.0"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "babel-core": "^6.26.0",
    "babel-preset-env": "^1.6.0",
    "babelify": "^8.0.0",
    "browserify": "^16.1.0",
    "http-server": "^0.11.0",
    "stringify": "^5.2.0"
  }
}
```
@highlight 10-15,only

Next, create an `app.stache` template for your app:

```html
{{! app.stache }}
<h1>{{message}}</h1>
```

Next, create an `index.js` module for your application. Import [can-component]
and your template to say ‚ÄúHello World‚Äù:

```js
// index.js
import Component from "can-component";
import template from "./app.stache";

Component.extend({
  tag: "my-app",
  view: template,
  ViewModel: {
    message: {
      default: "Hello World"
    }
  }
});
```

Next, run Browserify from your terminal:

```
./node_modules/browserify/bin/cmd.js --debug --transform babelify --transform stringify --entry index.js --outfile dist/bundle.js
```

Finally, create an `index.html` page that loads `dist/bundle.js` and includes
your `<my-app>` component:

```html
<!doctype html>
<title>CanJS and Browserify</title>
<script src="./dist/bundle.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
<my-app></my-app>
```
@highlight 3-4

Now you can load that page in your browser at one of the addresses the HTTP
server showed you earlier (something like [http://localhost:8080/]). You should
see ‚ÄúHello World‚Äù on the page‚Äîif you don‚Äôt, join our
[Gitter chat](https://gitter.im/canjs/canjs) and we can help you figure out what
went wrong.

## Script tags

### npm

After following the [npm instructions above](#npm), install the
[can](https://www.npmjs.com/package/can) package from npm:

```
npm install can --save
```

The `node_modules/can/dist/global/` directory will include two files:
- `can.ecosystem.js`: includes the [can-core core], [can-ecosystem ecosystem], and [can-infrastructure infrastructure] modules
- `can.js`: includes the [can-core core] and [can-infrastructure infrastructure] modules

With `can` installed, use it to create an `index.html` page with a `<script>` tag:

```html
<!doctype html>
<title>My CanJS App</title>
<script src="./node_modules/can/dist/global/can.ecosystem.js"></script>

<script type="text/stache" id="app-template">
  <h1>{{message}}</h1>
</script>

<script type="text/javascript">
  const template = can.stache.from("app-template");

  can.Component.extend({
    tag: "my-app",
    view: template,
    ViewModel: {
      message: {
        default: "Hello World"
      }

  });
</script>

### CDN

Another quick way to start locally is by loading CanJS from a CDN:

```html
<!doctype html>
<title>My CanJS App</title>
<script src="https://unpkg.com/can@4/dist/global/can.ecosystem.js"></script>

<my-app></my-app>

<script type="text/stache" id="app-template">
  <h1>{{message}}</h1>
</script>

<script type="text/javascript">
  const template = can.stache.from("app-template");

  can.Component.extend({
    tag: "my-app",
    view: template,
    ViewModel: {
      message: {
        default: "Hello World"
      }
    }
  });
</script>
```
