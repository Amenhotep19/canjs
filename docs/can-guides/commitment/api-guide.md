## Documentation Structure

The API docs are divided in 4 parts:

- Core
- Ecosystem
- Infrastructure
- Legacy

## Module Documentation

- Document what the module exports
- Signatures
- Use section

## How to find what you're looking for ...

- Get a good understand of the purpose behind each module.  
- Start with core modules
- Then checkout infrastructure modules

Likely you'll have a good way to start.  You can hover for descriptions.

If you don't find what you want on the lowest level, walk up to the parent module, it
might be in it's `#Use` section.  

If not, let us know!
