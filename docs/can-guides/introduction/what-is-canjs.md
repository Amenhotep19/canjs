CanJS is an evolving and improving set of client side JavaScript architectural
libraries that balances innovation and stability.

CanJS is one piece of the larger DoneJS framework, which provides a full stack
of tooling for building high performance, real-time web and mobile
applications.

CanJS, and each of its libraries, can be used in isolation, and are
individually useful, but are even more useful when combined together.

[//]: # (GRAPHIC: show CanJS as a piece of DoneJS, and itâ€™s modules as pieces themselves)

CanJS includes everything you need to build a modern, well architected
JavaScript application:

- Observable objects
- Computed properties
- Live binding templates
- Custom elements
- Service modeling and intelligent data caching
- Routing

The CanJS libraries are divided into four categories:

1. __The Core Collection__ - the core, most useful parts of the library.
2. __The Ecosystem Collection__ - extensions to the core collection, which may
be useful for some applications, like mocked AJAX requests, helpers for
importing modules, virtual DOM libraries, and two way data bindings
3. __The Infrastructure Collection__ - Lower level utilities that power the
core collection, generally not things that application developers will use
often, like low level JS and DOM utilities, the core parts of the template and
observable systems.
4. __The Legacy Collection__ - Supported former libraries that are no longer
actively developed, such as previous template engines and observable APIs.
